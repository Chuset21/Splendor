- Check w Miguel how to make sessions with different expansions
- Figure out how to do long polling

Goals w/ priority (Easiest and most essential jobs first)

1) LoadGameScreen
	a) Have it fetch current savedgames (no long polling necessary)

2) InLobbyScreen
	a) Show which player you are [e.g. "Maex (You)"]
	b) Implement long-polling to refresh players
		i) Make updatePlayers() function
		ii) Get long-polling to call that function when players change
		iii) Make lobbyscreen boot players out if session closes
	c) Don't display "Launch" button to non-hosts
	d) Make player icons into colored circles (cuz that's all we get from the LobbyService)

3) LobbySelectScreen
	a) Implement long-polling to refresh sessions
	b) Make join game button switch to full if session is full (i.e. make button green if available, greyed out if not)
	c) Should display if the session is launched/running
		i) Check if you are part of the launched session
		ii) Indicate if you can join (if above condition holds) (i.e. make button green if available, greyed out if not)
			I) If you can join an in-progress game, the join button should send you directly to the gameboard

4) Gameboard
	a) Add buttons to leave gameboard and return to lobby
		i) "Save and end" -> Saves game and deletes session (only available to host)
		ii) "Return to lobby" -> Returns to lobby screen without leaving session
	b) Make player icons into colored circles (cuz that's all we get from the LobbyService)
	c) be able to interpret gameboard sent from server [going to take a long time]
		i) read data
		ii) be able to display the data (in basegame)
	d) be able to make any possible move on the gameboard
		i) Take turns with gems & reserve cards -> Hook up with backend
